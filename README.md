# Features Hub

Features Hub is a modular collection of real, production-ready features for modern web development.  
Each feature is fully isolated in its own folder and includes:

- Frontend implementation  
- Backend implementation  
- Flow diagram for understanding the logic  
- Notes and explanations  
- Environment setup details (if required)

The goal of this repository is simple:  
**Help developers go beyond basics by providing real features they can understand, reuse, and integrate into any project.**
